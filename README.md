### [Certification Project: Build an Arithmetic Formatter Project](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/6_cert_arithmetic%20formatter.py)
Python script that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems (max 5, additions or subtractions), and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side like this:
```
  235
+  52
-----
```
The function can optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers are also displayed.
