### Certification Project: Build an Arithmetic Formatter Project
Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
```
  235
+  52
-----
```
Finish the `arithmetic_arranger` function that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers should be displayed.
