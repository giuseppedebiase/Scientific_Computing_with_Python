# Scientific Computing with Python
Projects from the freeCodeCamp's course "[Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)"

## Projects  
Two kinds of projects in this repo:  
"Learn X by Building Y": This are guided exercises where FCC teaches Python concepts.  
"Certification Project: Build X": Projects that you must submit to earn the certification. FCC gives you a (almost) blank IDE. 

List of Certification Projects:  
  * Arithmetic Formatter Project  
  * Time Calculator Project
  * Budget App Project
  * Polygon Area Calculator Project
  * Probability Calculator Project
  
[Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/1_vigenere.py)  
[Learn How to Work with Numbers and Strings by Implementing the Luhn Algorithm](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/2_luhn.py)  
[Learn Lambda Functions by Building an Expense Tracker](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/3_expense_tracker.py)  
[Learn Python List Comprehension by Building a Case Converter Program](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/4_case_converter.py)  
[Learn the Bisection Method by Finding the Square Root of a Number](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/5_square_root.py)

### [Certification Project: Build an Arithmetic Formatter Project](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/6_cert_arithmetic_formatter.py)
Python script that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems (max 5, additions or subtractions), and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side like this:
```
  235      3801
+  52    -    2
-----    ------
```
The function can optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers are also displayed.

[Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Password Generator](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/7_password_generator.py)  
[Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/8_shortest_path.py)  
[Learn Recursion-by Solving the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/9_recursive_hanoi.py)  
[Learn Data Structures By Building the Merge Sort Algorithm](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/10_merge_sort.py)  

### [Certification Project: Build a Time Calculator Project](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/11_cert_time_calculator.py)  
Python script that takes a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM) and a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes,
adds them and return the results. The function can optionally take a day of the week as a third parameter and, when this is given, the output should display
the day of the week of the result.  

[Learn Classes and Objects by Building a Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/12_sudoku_solver.py)  
[Learn Tree Traversal by Building a Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/Scientific_Computing_with_Python/blob/main/Projects/13_binary_search_tree.py)
